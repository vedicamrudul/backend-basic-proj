So first we created the errorhandlermiddlewear and the notFound middlewear cuz they remain more or less the same.

Next we connected our mongoDB to our app using mongoose. Then we started the server in app.js to test.

We created a controller file for products and created the methods for the routes. We also created a model file for products. GetAllProducts and getAllProductsStatic.

Now we created two routes in the route folder=> products file, for the above controller functions.

Then we wrote this in app.js :
require('express-async-errors');
This does the job of our asyncWrapper. We dont have to wrap our code in try catch cuz it automatically does that for us. 
If we throw an error it will automatically pass it to our errorHandling middlewear which we previously (in the previous project) had to do manually.
